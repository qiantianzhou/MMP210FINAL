# MMP210FINAL

I build a smart home system by using a hall effect sensor and LED. 
in this system, you can turn on the light at your house before you get home or when you go out, you forget to turn off the light, you can use this system to turn off the light. and also, when the door is open, the LED light will turn on and you can notice your door is open.

I choose this project because I think it will be useful.
